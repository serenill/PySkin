# PySkin
A powerful tool to personalize your desktop using Python.

## Overview üìÉ

__PySkin__ is a Python library that allows you to create widgets and show them in your desktop. The widgets are highly customizables. The user can add text, images, interactivity, colors and dinamic information to widgets throught the library and its methods. Also, he can resize, reshape and position them, as control wich widgets show, hide or delete. __PySkin__ will have other important functionalities related to __desktop customization__, such as task bar customization and controlling background music's reproduction.

The idea behind this proyect is to offer a flexible and easy to use interface for __desktop customization__. Thus, every user with experiencie in Python could personalize his desktop without too much complication or third-party softwares. 

## Roadmap üìÖ

__PySkin__ is a software in development. I'll update this repository and this document with the changes according to my job. I'll submit here library's requeriments, documentation, user's guide and demostrations too, as soon as the project is done. 

I'll develop the __main logic__ of the library. This is:

  - Widget's structure
  - Function to customize widgets (adding text, dinamic information, images or colors)
  - Function to customize widget's text (controlling font and position of texts)
  - Function to customize widget's form (controlling widget's shape, size and position on desktop)
  - Function to control widgets presence (show, hide or delete widgets)
  - Function to add local links to widgets
  - Function to add interactivity to widgets (dinamic responses to mouse and keyboard's events and a way to configure them)
  - Function to customize task bar (controlling task bar position and icons's shape, size)
  - Function to control background music's reproduction

Until the moment, the library will only works on Windows, because it use Windows's API. However, I'll consider to develop MacOS and Linux versions in a future.

__PySkin__ will be the core of __EntwineDesk__, an open-source software that I'll develop soon. This software allows you tu use all __PySkin's__ features without knowing Python. Instead, the software has an intuitive GUI with buttons linked to essencial __desktop customization's__ task. Thus, we get a simple GUI to make powerful customization by clicks, and the logic behind all of this is __PySkin__.

If you want to contribute, feel free to write code for any of the features described in this document or any new one you consider relevant to __desktop customization__ and then make a pull request. In this repository, you'll find the file __CONTRIBUITING.md__, wich contains an entire and detailed explication about how to contribute to this project.

__Also, you can support making "Star"__ ‚ù§Ô∏è
