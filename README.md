# PySkin
A powerful tool to personalize your desktop using Python.

## Overview ðŸ“ƒ

__PySkin__ is a Python library that allows you to create widgets and show them in your desktop. The widgets are highly customizables. The user can add text, images, interactivity, colors and dinamic information to widgets throught the library and its methods. Also, he can resize, reshape and position them too, just like control wich widgets show, hide or delete. __PySkin__ will have other important functionalities related to __desktop customization__, such as task bar customization and controlling background music's reproduction.

The idea behind this proyect is to offer a flexible and easy to use interface for __desktop customization__. Thus, every user with experiencie in Python could personalize his desktop without too much complication or third-party softwares. 

## Roadmap ðŸ“…

__PySkin__ is a software in development. I'll update this repository and this document with the changes according to my job. I'll submit here too library's requeriments, documentation, user's guide and demostrations as soon as the project is done. 

I'll develop the __main logic__ of the library. This is:

  . Widget's structure
  . Function to customize widgets (adding text, dinamic information, images or colors).
  . Function to customize widget's text (controlling font and position of texts).
  . Function to customize widget's form (controlling widget's shape, size and position on desktop).
  . Function to control widgets presence (controlling show, hide or delete widgets).
  . Function to add local links to widgets.
  . Function to add interactivity to widgets (dinamic responses to mouse and keyboard's events and a way to configure them).
  . Function to customize task bar (controlling task bar position and icons's shape, size).
  . Function to control background music's reproduction.
